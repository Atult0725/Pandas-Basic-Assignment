    "'''Q4. What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.series? Explain with an example.\n",
    "Ans-DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas. It can be thought of as a table or spreadsheet consisting of rows and columns. Each column can have a different data type (such as float, int, string, etc.), and each row has a unique label or index. DataFrame is a versatile data structure that allows users to perform various operations on data, such as filtering, joining, merging, and reshaping.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Series is a one-dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas, which is similar to a column in a DataFrame. A Series can contain data of any data type (such as float, int, string, etc.) and has a unique label or index for each value in the series.\n",

    "you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-Pandas DataFrame provides a wide range of functions to manipulate data. Some of the common functions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "head() and tail() - To view the first or last few rows of the DataFrame. These functions can be useful when we want to have a quick glance at the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "info() and describe() - info() provides the summary of the DataFrame including the data types of each column and the number of non-null values. describe() provides the statistical summary of the numerical columns of the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "sort_values() - To sort the rows of a DataFrame based on one or more columns. This function can be useful when we want to find the top or bottom values in a DataFrame based on a particular column.\n",
    "\n",
    "groupby() and agg() - groupby() is used to group the rows of a DataFrame based on one or more columns. agg() is used to perform aggregations on the grouped data. These functions can be useful when we want to calculate summary statistics for different groups in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "drop() and fillna() - drop() is used to drop rows or columns from the DataFrame. fillna() is used to fill missing values in the DataFrame. These functions can be useful when we want to clean the DataFrame before analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "apply() - To apply a function to each element of a DataFrame. This function can be useful when we want to perform some custom operation on the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "merge() - To merge two or more DataFrames based on one or more columns. This function can be useful when we want to combine data from multiple sources into a single DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can use the groupby() function to group the data by a particular column, and then use the agg() function to calculate summary statistics for each group. For instance, we can group a DataFrame of sales data by the product category column, and then calculate the total revenue and average price for each category using the agg() function.\n",
